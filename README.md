Solutions for Inception

## 1.cpp

You are given S a sequence of n integers i.e. S = s1, s2, ..., sn. Compute if it is possible to split S into two parts : s1, s2, ..., si and si+1, si+2, â€¦.., sn (0 <= i <= n) in such a way that the first part is strictly decreasing while the second is strictly increasing one.
That is, in the sequence if numbers are decreasing, they can start increase at one point. And once number starts increasing, they cannot decrease at any point further.
Sequence made up of only increasing numbers or only decreasing numbers is a valid sequence. So in both the cases, print true.
You just need to print true/false.

Input format :
Line 1 : Integer n
Line 2 : n integers (separated by space)

Output Format :
"true" or "false" (without quotes)


## 2.cpp

Given a number N, find its square root. You need to find and print only the integral part of square root of N.
For eg. if number given is 18, answer is 4.

Input format :
Integer N

Output Format :
Square root of N (integer part only)


## 3.cpp

Write a program to print first x terms of the series 3N + 2 which are not multiples of 4.
N varies from 1 to 1000.

Input format :
Integer x

Output format :
Terms of series (separated by space)

## 4.cpp

Print reverse number.Take care of constraints like presence of zeroes.

Integer N

Constraints:
Time Limit: 1 second

Output format :
Corresponding reverse number

## 5.cpp

Convert Decimal to Binary with the help of Bitwise operators

## 6.cpp

Dynamically allocate a 2d matrix.Jagged arrays in CPP are possible because of this.
